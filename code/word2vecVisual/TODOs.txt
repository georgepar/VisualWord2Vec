List of todos:

- Read the test and validation files better (solve memory allocation problem) (done)
- Compute the scores for each of test, train. (done)
- Write cross-validation code in C (done)
- Compute the accuracy and match it with matlab accuracies (done)
- Vary learning rate, use differential learning rates (done)
- Vary number of clusters (done)
- Use averaging as opposed to just words (done) (done)
- Can we use just sentences and abstract geometry vectors? (done)
- Regressing with the actual visual vectors - might have to include dropout (defer)
- Use the modified visual features instead of binary (done)
- remove NUM_CLUSTERS (done)
- remove NUM_TRAINING (done)
- remove prs to train (done)
- remove VISUAL_FEATURE_SIZE (done)
- Generalize the last layer (defer)
- Get the numbers for all the various settings (done, multi model left)
- Perform PCA for the visual features before clustering (done, offline, matlab)
- Perform a sweep for various number of clusters (done)
- Train different models for P,R,S (done)
- Keep track of best validation and test accuracies (done)
- Iteration over dataset based on performance on validation set (done)
- Check overfitting based on performance on validation and testing (train and test?) (done)
- Replace total sweep with symmetric sweep in simple cosDist evaluation (done)
- Get the options into command line arguments for faster chain execution (done, modified for now)
- Save the word2vec for different runs for faster chain execution (done)
- Also use Wiki to train word2vec, instead of MS COCO
- Use the new features for training (done)
- Re-compute the scores for all the experiments (done)
- Setup t-SNE embeddings
- Get the embeddings which differ a lot and are positively classified (done)
- Visualize using t-SNE
- Get the plot of accuracy vs amount of training data (done for one model, more info on this)
