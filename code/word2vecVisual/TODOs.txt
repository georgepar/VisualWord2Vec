List of todos:

- Read the test and validation files better (solve memory allocation problem) (done)
- Compute the scores for each of test, train. (done)
- Write cross-validation code in C (done)
- Compute the accuracy and match it with matlab accuracies (done)
- Vary learning rate, use differential learning rates (done)
- Vary number of clusters (done)
- Also use Wiki to train word2vec, instead of MS COCO
- Use averaging as opposed to just words (done) (done)
- Can we use just sentences and abstract geometry vectors? (done)
- Regressing with the actual visual vectors - might have to include dropout (defer)
- Use the modified visual features instead of binary (done)
- remove NUM_CLUSTERS (done)
- remove NUM_TRAINING (done)
- remove prs to train (done)
- remove VISUAL_FEATURE_SIZE (done)
- Generalize the last layer (defer)
- Get the numbers for all the various settings
- Perform PCA for the visual features before clustering (done, offline, matlab)
- Perform a sweep for various number of clusters (steps of 2/3)
- Train different models for P,R,S
- Keep track of best validation and test accuracies (done)
- Iteration over dataset based on performance on validation set (done)
- Check overfitting based on performance on validation and testing (train and test?) (done)
- Replace total sweep with symmetric sweep in simple cosDist evaluation
