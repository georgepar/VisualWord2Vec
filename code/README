1.  learnModelSweepWrapper.m
    learnModelSweep.m
    learnModelSweepEvaluation.m

    Files used to split the pipeline into three parts to facilitate
    multiple runs using varied amounts of training data(2,4,6,8,..20).
    learnModelSweepWrapper randomly chooses training data, learnModelSweep
    learns the model using the chosen data, learnModelSweepEvalation 
    performs the evaluation of Textual, Visual, Textual + Visual features
    for the trained model.
